## Editing the gh-pages branch (not this one)

**THIS IS NOT THE GH-PAGES BRANCH! EDIT THE [GH-PAGES BRANCH](../../tree/gh-pages) INSTEAD OF THIS ONE!**

If you're forking this repository, you'll want to edit the `gh-pages` branch and replace the session details at the bottom of `index.html` with your own.

Your final url will be something like this:

https://kidgodzilla.github.io/puffer-firetv-example/

(with the username being your own).
